# Notes

Working notes, hypotheses, and investigative thinking.

## For Claude

Use this folder for:
- Brainstorming and hypothesis development
- Questions to pursue
- Observations that don't fit elsewhere yet
- Session notes and thinking

Notes are informal working documents. They help track investigative reasoning and can be refined into formal analysis later.
