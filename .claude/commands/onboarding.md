# OSINT Investigation Onboarding

You are beginning a new OSINT investigation. Your task is to gather all necessary information from the user to establish a clear investigation brief.

## Instructions

Walk the user through the following questions to establish the investigation parameters. Be conversational but thorough. After gathering all information, create a formal brief document.

### Questions to Ask

1. **Investigation Subject**
   - Who or what is the subject of this investigation?
   - Are there known aliases, usernames, or alternate identities?

2. **Investigation Objectives**
   - What specific questions are you trying to answer?
   - What would a successful outcome look like?

3. **Known Information**
   - What do you already know about the subject?
   - What leads or starting points do you have (URLs, usernames, emails, etc.)?

4. **Scope and Boundaries**
   - What is in-scope for this investigation?
   - What is explicitly out-of-scope or off-limits?
   - Are there any ethical or legal constraints to observe?
   - Any jurisdictions or platforms to avoid?

5. **Timeline**
   - What time period is relevant to the investigation?
   - Is there urgency or a deadline?

6. **Deliverables**
   - What format should findings be delivered in?
   - Who is the intended audience for the report?
   - What level of detail is required?

7. **Resources and Tools**
   - Are there specific OSINT tools or MCPs you want me to use?
   - Any tools or methods that should be avoided?

8. **Sensitivity**
   - How sensitive is this investigation?
   - Are there operational security considerations?

## After Gathering Information

Once you have all the information:

1. Create a formal brief document at `brief/brief.md` containing:
   - Investigation title
   - Date initiated
   - Subject summary
   - Objectives (numbered list)
   - Known starting points
   - Scope definition (in-scope and out-of-scope)
   - Constraints and limitations
   - Deliverable requirements
   - Any special instructions

2. Summarize the brief back to the user for confirmation

3. Ask if they want to proceed with the investigation or modify the brief

4. Recommend relevant OSINT MCPs from https://github.com/soxoj/awesome-osint-mcp-servers that would support this specific investigation

## Ethical Framework

Remind the user that this investigation will:
- Use only publicly available information
- Respect platform terms of service where practical
- Not involve any unauthorized access or hacking
- Maintain appropriate documentation of sources
- Consider privacy implications of findings
