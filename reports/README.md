# Reports

Formal deliverables and investigation outputs.

## Structure

- **drafts/** - Work-in-progress reports
- **final/** - Completed, reviewed reports

## For Claude

Generate reports using the `/report` command. Reports should:
- Be written for the intended audience (technical vs. executive vs. legal)
- Include executive summary
- Present findings with confidence levels
- Cite all evidence
- Note limitations and gaps
- Provide recommendations where appropriate

Use drafts/ for iterative development. Move to final/ only after user approval.
