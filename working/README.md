# Working

Temporary workspace for in-progress tasks.

## For Claude

Use this folder for:
- Intermediate processing outputs
- Temporary files
- Work that doesn't have a home yet
- Experimental analysis

Files here are transient. Move completed work to appropriate folders.
Clean up regularly to avoid clutter.
