# Brief

This folder contains the investigation brief and scope documentation.

## Purpose

Store all foundational documents that define the investigation:
- Initial client brief (generated via `/onboarding`)
- Scope definitions and boundaries
- Research questions and objectives
- Ethical guidelines and constraints

## For Claude

When starting any investigation task, check this folder first for:
- `brief.md` - The primary investigation brief
- Any scope amendments or clarifications
- Defined boundaries (what is in/out of scope)

The brief defines your investigative mandate. Do not pursue leads outside the defined scope without explicit user approval.
