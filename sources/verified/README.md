# Verified Sources

Sources confirmed as authentic and reliable.

## For Claude

A source is "verified" when:
- Authenticity is confirmed (official source, corroborated by multiple independent sources)
- Content has been validated
- No indicators of manipulation or fabrication

Document verification reasoning for each source.
