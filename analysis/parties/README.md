# Parties

Working files for investigation parties (people, organizations, accounts).

## For Claude

This folder contains working documents for entities under investigation. These are less formal than full entity profiles and can be used for:

- Initial notes on a party before full profiling
- Aggregated research snippets
- Quick reference sheets
- Comparison documents

Files here should reference or eventually become profiles in `entity-profiles/`.

## Naming Convention

Use code names where assigned, otherwise descriptive names:
- `ALPHA.md` (code name)
- `company-xyz.md` (no code name yet)

## Relationship to Graph

Parties documented here should have corresponding entries in `graph/entities.json`. Use the graph for programmatic relationship queries; use these files for human-readable context.
