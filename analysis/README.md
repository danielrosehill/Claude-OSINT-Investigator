## For Claude

This is where you synthesize raw evidence into analytical products. Each analysis should:
- Reference specific evidence files that support conclusions
- Clearly distinguish facts from inferences
- Note confidence levels (high/medium/low)
- Identify gaps requiring further investigation

Update analyses as new evidence emerges. Maintain version history for significant revisions.
