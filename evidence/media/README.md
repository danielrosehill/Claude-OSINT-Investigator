# Media

Images, videos, and audio files collected as evidence.

## For Claude

- Store media files with descriptive names
- Note: You cannot directly view images, but can help organize and document them
- Request user assistance for media analysis tasks
- Document metadata (EXIF, etc.) in companion files when available
