# Processed Evidence

Evidence that has been cleaned, formatted, extracted, or otherwise transformed.

## For Claude

- Always reference the original file in `raw/` when creating processed versions
- Document transformations applied in companion `.meta.md` files
- Maintain clear links between raw and processed versions
